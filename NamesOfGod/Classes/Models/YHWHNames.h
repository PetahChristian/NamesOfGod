/**
 YHWHNames is a singleton that manages names of God (model) data.

 The names are stored as a collated array of arrays (of name objects), and may be
 accessed via a conventional (section and row) indexPath.

 Each name, along with related data, is stored in a `YHWHName` object.

 ## Filtering the name data

 In addition to managing the complete (unfiltered) names of God, the singleton also
 manages a filtered set of names.
